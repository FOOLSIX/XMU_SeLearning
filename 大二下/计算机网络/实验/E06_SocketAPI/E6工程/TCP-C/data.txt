<Let life be beautiful like summer flowers>
By Rabindranath Tagore

Life, thin and light-off time and time again
Frivolous tireless

I heard the echo, from the valleys and the heart
Open to the lonely soul of sickle harvesting
Repeat outrightly, but also repeat the well-being of
Eventually swaying in the desert oasis
I believe I am
Born as the bright summer flowers
Do not withered undefeated fiery demon rule
Heart rate and breathing to bear the load of the cumbersome
Bored

I heard the music, from the moon and carcass
Auxiliary extreme aestheticism bait to capture misty
Filling the intense life, but also filling the pure
There are always memories throughout the earth
I believe I am
Died as the quiet beauty of autumn leaves
Sheng is not chaos, smoke gesture
Even wilt also retained bone proudly Qing Feng muscle
Occult

I hear love, I believe in love
Love is a pool of struggling blue-green algae
As desolate micro-burst of wind
Bleeding through my veins
Years stationed in the belief
